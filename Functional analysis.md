# Functional analysis

>  üõ†Ô∏è Nov 2023

This is an overview of carrying out functional analysis of a gene list of interest. This is particularly useful for example, if you have a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and you are trying to identify what is their function, where are they located etc. 

There are two main programs I recommend for this analysis and I will go through how to use both of them. The first is using the (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery)[https://david.ncifcrf.gov], also known as **DAVID**. The second is a program run in the networking App (Cytoscape)[https://cytoscape.org] called **ClueGO**. Both have their pro's and con's, so I usually carry out both sets of analysis and decide which is best for what and how I want to show my data. 

Finally, I will go through how to visualise the results using barcharts, heatmaps, or dotplots. 

## DAVID functional analysis

One of the main benefits of using DAVID is the vast amount of categories that you obtain as well as various statistical and functional analysis options. However, this is also one of its downsides, meaning it requires more effort and time for appropriate visualisation. As well, due to the nature of how terms are names, particularly when using functional annotations known as KEGG pathways, terms can be non-descriptive or false-descriptive (i.e., the name is not appropriate to your list of gene), but more on this later.

First, lets navigate to the (DAVID homepage)[https://david.ncifcrf.gov]. The click the tab at the top that says *Start Analysis*. You are now presented with a screen divided into two sections: on the left you have three tabs called *Upload*, *List*, and *Background*. On the right you will see the output from your analysis.
