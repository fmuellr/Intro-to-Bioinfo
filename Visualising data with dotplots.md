# Visualising data with dotplots

>  üõ†Ô∏è Nov 2023

One of my favourite methods of visualising functional analysis data is by using dotplots. These let you plot both the significance and gene count within the same figure, whereas using bar charts or heatmaps, this needs to be plotted separately. Dotplots are also used to view single cell data, and is part of the **seurat** package (see single-cell RNA sequencing).

## Package setup and overview

This information is based on the Let's Plot series by [David McGaughey](https://davemcg.github.io/post/lets-plot-scrna-dotplots/). While i have massively simplified these plots, if you are interested in changing other parameters, head to his website to have a look.
