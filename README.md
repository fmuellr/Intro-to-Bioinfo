# Bioinformatic Analysis in the SDG lab!

Hello and welcome to your crash course in bioinformatic analysis in the lab! 

Regardless of your coding experience if you're interested in learning how to analyse your own data here are some handy guides. 
If you have no previous coding experience, this can feel a bit daunting, but think about it like learning a new language. We will mainly be using three programming langauges, Command Line, R and Python. I would highly recommend making use of [Imperial's data science courses](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/) - these are a great resource and will give you a kickstart in understanding basic coding language and help you write your first scripts so you can understand more complicated scripts in the future. I'd highly recommed completing at least:

- [Basic statistics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/basic-statistics/)
- [Introduction to R](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/r-programming/)
- [Data processing with R](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/data-processing-with-r/)
- [Introduction to Python](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/intro-to-python/)
- [The Linux command line for scientific computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/linux-command-line-for-scientific-computing/
- [Introduction to HPC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/introduction-to-hpc/)
- [Data exploration and visualisation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/data-exploration-visualisation/)
- [Introduction to Git and Github for software development](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/introduction-to-using-git-and-github-for-software-development/)


These will give you the fundamentals from which you can build on, if you are interested in learning more. Make sure to book these as soon as possible because the spaces get filled very quickly.
